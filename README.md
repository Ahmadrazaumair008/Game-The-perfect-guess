# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game written in Python. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. The game will prompt you to enter a number.
3. Enter your guess and press Enter.
4. The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
5. Keep guessing until you guess the correct number.
6. The game will then tell you how many guesses it took you to win.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  # Create the environment
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate on Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate on Windows
